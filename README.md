# Welcome to Skate It!

This app was created with React!

## How to Start the App

To get started, fork this repo into your local environment.  Once done, install the dependencies need to run the app by typing 'npm install' into your terminal. Next, you will want to boot up the server by typing 'json-server --watch db.json' into the terminal.  Now things should be all set to start!  Open a new tab in your terminal and type 'npm start'.

## Quick Overview of the App

Skate it was created to allow skateboarders to upload or find DIY skateparks in cities and towns accross the US! This app has four client-side routes: Home, About, Search, and Add. The navigation bar containing these routes is located at the top of the page below the title.  Clicking on one of these routes will take you to that page in order to interact with the app or learn more about it!

## Home

The Home page essentially welcomes all users to the app.  There's nothing special here, but thanks for coming anyways!

## About

Here's where you'll learn how to use the app and learn more about what inspired the creation of skate it!

## Search

In this section you'll be able to search for different DIY spots from across the US.  Simply type in a city or state name and a list of DIY spots in that area will append to the page.  You can click on the name of the DIY to get more details on the spot.

## Add

This section allows you to add a new spot to the API!  Fill out all the fields in the form.  The fields include spot name, city, state, street address, image URL, and description.  We greatly appreciate any additions to our growing database.  The more, the merrier!

## Future Updates

We thank you for checking out our application!  In the future we intend to add a new route to update any spots within our API, a like button, a comment section, and more!
